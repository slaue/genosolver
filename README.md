# The GENO solver

[![Build Status](https://app.travis-ci.com/slaue/genosolver.svg?branch=master)](https://app.travis-ci.com/slaue/genosolver)

GENO is a solver for non-linear optimization problems. It can solve constrained and unconstrained problems. It is fully written in Python with no dependencies and it can run on the CPU and on the GPU.

## Installing

```
pip install genosolver
```
